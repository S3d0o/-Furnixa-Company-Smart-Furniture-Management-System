# ⚙️ Stored Procedures

This folder contains stored procedures used across Furnixa for modular business logic execution.

Stored procedures help:
- Handle reusable logic (e.g., insert/update workflows).
- Secure operations by controlling parameterized access.
- Simplify application integration with well-defined interfaces.

Each procedure is named clearly and includes parameters for flexible usage.
