# 🔁 Triggers

This folder contains SQL triggers used in the Furnixa system.

Triggers are used to:
- Track sensitive changes, such as salary modifications.
- Maintain data integrity and enforce business rules at the database level.

Each trigger is scoped to a specific table (e.g., Employee, Product, Order).
